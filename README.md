## Overview

This is a [SimpleRPC Audit Plugin](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/simplerpc/auditing.html) that writes audit events to a json file that can
easily be consumed by logstash.

[Logstash](http://www.logstash.net/) is an opensource project that stores log lines and allow you to do full text and meta data based searches on that data.

The image above shows a screenshot of Kibana showing all RPC requests made by a specific client, you can also see meta data for one of the requests.

Installation
------------

 * Follow the [basic plugin install guide](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/mcollective-plugins/wiki/InstalingPlugins).
 * You need to have the JSON RubyGem install on all nodes

Configuration
-------------

The logfile defaults to /var/log/mcollective-audit.log but can be changed as below, you also need to enable auditing as per the example below:

     rpcaudit = 1
     rpcauditprovider = logstash
     plugin.logstash.logfile = /var/log/mcollective-logstashaudit.log

Logstash
--------

A possible Logstash shipper configuration might look like this.

    input {
      file {
        type => 'mcollective-audit'
        path => '/var/log/mcollective-audit.log'
        format => json_event
      }
    }

This tells the log shipper to fetch audit log entries from the same location that youâ€™ve configured above in the mcollective config.
